input format
output format
datatype size (mostly int)

test list
    always put input in a file (e.g., p12345.in) so you can make sure
the changes don't make a test fail that used to pass
    diff the new version's output with the old output

    example cases
    test the maximum test case size (use script to generate if needed)
